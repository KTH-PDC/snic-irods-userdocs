About Swestore
```````````````

Swestore is National Research Data Storage Infrastructure operated by the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (`SNIC <http://www.snic.se>`_). 

The resources provided by Swestore are made available through open procedures such that the best Swedish research is supported and new research is facilitated. The purpose of Swestore allocations, granted by Swedish National Allocations Committee (`SNAC <http://www.snic.vr.se/snic-committees/snac>`_), is to provide large scale data storage for “live” or “working” research data, also known as active research data.

Due to the current funding model, the available allocations on Swestore have some usage limitations.

 * Swestore is NOT supposed to be used for backups and such requests for allocation will be rejected. Please, check with your university (home institution/organisation) IT department about backup services, strategies and policies in place. If such services do not exist or if you can’t access them for different reasons, please contact us at support@swestore.se;
 * Swestore is NOT supposed to be used as archiving service, long-term storage or repository for “static” data. Once data is no longer in the process of change, and decision on which data should be retained shared and/or preserved has been taken, data should be moved toward appropriate data services. The higher education institutions are responsible for archiving and long-term preservation of research data produced by researchers employed by them;
