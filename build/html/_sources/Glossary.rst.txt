 Active (Research) data
   Is data that is being worked on as part of research project and therefore subject to change. The files containing data will need to be accessed and amended or updated as new data is gathered or processed.

 Archive
   Is a service to record, organise, and store (digital) items in optimal conditions, with standardised labelling to ensure their longevity and continued access. The service is based on application of metadata, archiving policies, records management, and digital preservation actions. Archivists make decisions on selection and retention of items which are usually governed by supporting policies.

 Backup
    Is a copy of the digital data to be stored and used as a replacement in case the main copy is either deleted or corrupted.

 Static (Research) data
    Is data that is no longer in the process of change and it can be prepared for preservation and reuse.
